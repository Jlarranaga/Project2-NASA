//TODO Ask Timm, would I have to have mulitple models? for each API? 
//Answer: You do not need a seperate model for each API. Schema is onlu used for saving data not displaying data. 

//Favorites model, add notes to fav image, owner field, favorites tab. 
//Parse how to get that data, build request body on API responses. 

//Data from API can be shown BUT doesnt have to be saved

//last router on places app, shows data from API but doesnt neccssary save that data unless we want. 
//... this allows us to show any data we want and only save what we need to users favorites. 

//TODO Work on ERD and WIREFRAME - later on.
